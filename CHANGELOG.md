- The ability to pass the token as a string to the `TokenService::getUserFromToken()` method instead of always getting the token from the `Authorization` HTTP header ([#75](https://github.com/jamesedmonston/graphql-authentication/pull/75), thanks [@nstCactus](https://github.com/nstCactus)!)

- Creating new entries via a mutation no longer forces the author to be the current user, if an `authorId` argument is supplied (note: it still respects the `Restricted Entry Mutations` plugin settings!) ([#63](https://github.com/jamesedmonston/graphql-authentication/pull/63), thanks [@cliveportman](https://github.com/cliveportman)!)

## 1.11.5 - 2021-09-27

### Fixed

- Fixed issue with errors being thrown as `Something went wrong when processing the GraphQL query.` instead of contextual errors. E.g. requests with an expired token will now throw `Invalid Authorization Header`

## 1.11.4 - 2021-09-23

### Fixed

- Fixed issue with `restrictForbiddenFields` throwing errors too eagerly ([#71](https://github.com/jamesedmonston/graphql-authentication/issues/71))

## 1.10.0 - 2021-05-07

### Added

### Changed

- Further improvements to performance by reducing the number of database calls and loops

- Fixed plugin causing an error with console requests

## 1.9.0 - 2021-05-04

### Changed

- The plugin no longer creates Craft GraphQL tokens â€“ schemas encoded into JWTs are now directly passed into Craft's GraphQL controller! ([#29](https://github.com/jamesedmonston/graphql-authentication/issues/29) via [@approached](https://github.com/approached))
- Lots of under-the-hood improvements to improve performance by reducing the number of database calls

## 1.3.3 - 2020-12-10

### Changed

### Misc

- Lots of under-the-hood tidying to make maintenance a lot easier
